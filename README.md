Using Machine Learning for Stress Level Prediction : 

Our app leverages the power of machine learning algorithms to analyze user responses and predict stress levels. This enables us to offer personalized recommendations and interventions for effective stress management.

We collect data such as sleeping hours, heart rate, blood oxygen levels etc. from the user based on which the prediction of his/her stress level will be made.
